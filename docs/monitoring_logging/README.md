# Security Monitoring and Logging

In this section, we focus on implementing security monitoring and logging practices to enhance the visibility and security of your Linux servers. Effective monitoring and logging are essential for detecting potential security incidents and ensuring accountability.

## Topics Covered

- [File and Directory Permissions](file_directory_permissions.md): Best practices for managing file and directory permissions to maintain system security.
- [Centralized Logging](centralized_logging.md): Techniques for implementing centralized logging to collect and analyze logs from multiple sources.
- [Audit Trails](audit_trails.md): Steps to enable and manage audit trails for tracking security-relevant events.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into monitoring and logging, ensure that you have completed the foundational and advanced hardening steps to establish a secure baseline for your server.

## Usage

Each topic in this section provides detailed instructions and best practices for implementing the specific monitoring or logging practice. Follow the guides to apply these measures to your Linux server.
