# Security Scanners

## Overview

Security scanners are tools that help identify vulnerabilities and security weaknesses in your Linux server. They play a crucial role in the security hardening process by providing insights into potential threats. This guide covers popular security scanners and their usage in assessing server security.

## OpenVAS

- **Description:** OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) is an open-source vulnerability scanner that can detect a wide range of security issues.
- **Usage:** Install OpenVAS on your system and use its web interface, the Greenbone Security Assistant, to configure and run scans against your server.
- **Example Command:**
  ```bash
  openvas-setup   # Set up OpenVAS
  openvas-start   # Start the OpenVAS services
  ```

## Nessus

- **Description:** Nessus is a commercial vulnerability scanner known for its extensive plugin library and regular updates.
- **Usage:** Install Nessus on your system, configure scan policies, and run scans to identify vulnerabilities. Nessus Essentials offers a free version with limited functionality.
- **Example Command:**
  ```bash
  nessuscli update  # Update Nessus plugins
  nessusd -q        # Start the Nessus daemon
  ```

## Qualys

- **Description:** Qualys is a cloud-based vulnerability scanner that offers continuous monitoring and compliance reporting.
- **Usage:** Sign up for a Qualys account, configure scanning options, and use the web interface to manage and run scans on your server.
- **Example Usage:** Access the Qualys web interface and create a new scan targeting your server's IP address.

## Nmap

- **Description:** Nmap (Network Mapper) is an open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing.
- **Usage:** Use Nmap to scan your server for open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
- **Example Command:**
  ```bash
  nmap -sV -T4 -A -v 192.168.1.1  # Scan for services and vulnerabilities
  ```

## Metasploit

- **Description:** Metasploit is a framework for penetration testing and exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Usage:** Use Metasploit to test your server for known vulnerabilities and validate the effectiveness of your security measures.
- **Example Usage:** Launch the Metasploit console and use modules to exploit identified vulnerabilities.

## Best Practices

- **Regular Scanning:** Schedule regular scans to detect new vulnerabilities as they emerge.
- **Remediate Findings:** Prioritize and address identified vulnerabilities to reduce the risk of exploitation.
- **Validate Remediation:** Re-scan after remediation to ensure that vulnerabilities have been successfully resolved.
- **Stay Informed:** Keep up with the latest security news and updates to ensure your scanning tools are up-to-date and effective.

By incorporating security scanners into your security practices, you can proactively identify and address vulnerabilities, enhancing the overall security of your Linux server.
