# Network Security

In this section, we explore various aspects of network security to protect your Linux server from unauthorized access and potential attacks. Effective network security measures are crucial for safeguarding data and maintaining the integrity of your server.

## Topics Covered

- [Firewall Configuration](firewall_configuration.md): Best practices for configuring firewalls using `iptables` and `nftables` to control network traffic.
- [TCP Wrappers](tcp_wrappers.md): An overview of using TCP Wrappers for additional access control for network services.
- [Network Segmentation](network_segmentation.md): Techniques for dividing a network into smaller segments to improve security and manageability.

## Prerequisites

Before delving into network security, ensure that you have completed the foundational and advanced hardening steps to establish a secure baseline for your server.

## Usage

Each topic in this section provides detailed instructions and best practices for implementing specific network security measures. Follow the guides to apply these practices to your Linux server.
