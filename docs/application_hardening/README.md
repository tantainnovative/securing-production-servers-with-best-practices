# Application Hardening

Application hardening involves implementing security measures to protect applications from vulnerabilities and attacks. In this section, we cover best practices for securing web servers, databases, and containerized environments.

## Topics Covered

- [Web Server Security](web_server_security.md): Guidelines for hardening web servers like Apache and Nginx against common web-based threats.
- [Database Security](database_security.md): Recommendations for securing database servers and protecting sensitive data.
- [Container Security](container_security.md): Best practices for securing containerized environments and ensuring the integrity of containerized applications.

## Prerequisites

Before delving into application hardening, ensure that you have completed the foundational and advanced hardening steps to establish a secure baseline for your server.

## Usage

Each topic in this section provides detailed instructions and best practices for securing specific application components. Follow the guides to apply these practices to your Linux server.
