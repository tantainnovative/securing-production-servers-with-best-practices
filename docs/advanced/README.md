# Advanced Hardening Techniques

In this section, we dive into advanced hardening techniques that provide an additional layer of security to your Linux servers. These techniques are aimed at further reducing the attack surface, enhancing access controls, and securing network communication.

## Topics Covered

- [Secure SSH](secure_ssh.md): Best practices for securing SSH (Secure Shell) service to safeguard remote access to your server.
- [Enable SELinux](enable_selinux.md): Steps to enable and configure Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) for fine-grained access control.
- [Network Parameters](network_parameters.md): Tuning network parameters to enhance the security and performance of your server's network stack.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with these advanced hardening techniques, ensure that you have completed the [foundational hardening steps](../foundational/README.md) to establish a secure baseline for your server.

## Usage

Each topic in this section provides detailed instructions and best practices for implementing the specific hardening technique. Follow the guides to apply these measures to your Linux server.
