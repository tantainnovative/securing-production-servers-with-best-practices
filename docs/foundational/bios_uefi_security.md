# BIOS/UEFI Security

## Overview

The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is the firmware that initializes your hardware during the boot process. Securing the BIOS/UEFI is a critical step in hardening your Linux servers, as it is the first line of defense against low-level attacks that target the boot process.

## Importance

- **Pre-boot Security:** Protects the system from unauthorized modifications before the operating system loads.
- **Root of Trust:** Establishes a secure foundation for the entire boot process.
- **Protection Against Malware:** Helps prevent rootkits and boot-time malware from compromising the system.

## Steps to Secure BIOS/UEFI

1. **Set a Strong Password:**
   - Access your BIOS/UEFI settings during system startup (usually by pressing a key like F2, F10, or DEL).
   - Set a strong password to prevent unauthorized access to BIOS/UEFI settings.

2. **Disable Boot from External Devices:**
   - In the BIOS/UEFI settings, disable options that allow booting from external devices like USB drives or CDs, unless necessary for your environment.

3. **Enable Secure Boot:**
   - Secure Boot is a feature in UEFI that ensures only trusted software with a valid digital signature can be booted.
   - Enable Secure Boot to protect against boot-time malware and rootkits.

4. **Update the Firmware:**
   - Regularly check for and apply firmware updates provided by your hardware manufacturer. These updates often contain security patches for vulnerabilities in the BIOS/UEFI.

5. **Limit Access to BIOS/UEFI Settings:**
   - Physically secure your server to prevent unauthorized access to BIOS/UEFI settings. Consider using locks, security cages, or secure data center facilities.

## Best Practices

- **Regular Firmware Updates:** Stay informed about firmware updates from your hardware vendor and apply them promptly.
- **Secure Configuration:** Review all BIOS/UEFI settings and ensure they are configured for optimal security, such as disabling unused ports and interfaces.
- **Backup Settings:** If your BIOS/UEFI supports it, back up the configuration settings for recovery in case of corruption or misconfiguration.
- **Monitor for Unauthorized Changes:** Implement monitoring mechanisms to detect any unauthorized changes to BIOS/UEFI settings.

By securing the BIOS/UEFI settings, you can protect your Linux servers from low-level threats and ensure that the boot process is secure from the outset. This foundational step is crucial for the overall security of your system.
