# Foundational Hardening Steps

Welcome to the Foundational Hardening Steps section of the Linux Hardening Guide. In this section, we focus on the essential steps that form the foundation of a secure Linux server. These steps are crucial for establishing a strong security baseline and reducing the attack surface of your systems.

## Topics Covered

1. **[System Inventory and Baseline Configuration](system_inventory.md):** Understand the importance of documenting your system's hardware and software configurations to establish a security baseline.

2. **[BIOS/UEFI Security](bios_uefi_security.md):** Learn how to secure your system's firmware settings to protect against low-level attacks and unauthorized modifications.

3. **[Disk Encryption and Partitioning](disk_encryption.md):** Explore the benefits of full disk encryption and strategic disk partitioning to protect data at rest and enhance system integrity.

4. **[Boot Directory Protection](boot_directory_protection.md):** Discover how to secure the boot directory to prevent tampering with critical boot files and ensure a safe startup process.

5. **[Disabling Unnecessary USB Ports](disabling_usb_ports.md):** Find out how to restrict USB port usage to prevent data leaks and malware infections through unauthorized devices.

6. **[Regular System Updates](system_updates.md):** Emphasize the importance of keeping your system up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities.

7. **[Package Management](package_management.md):** Learn about proper package management practices, including auditing installed packages and removing unnecessary software to minimize the attack surface.

## Objectives

By the end of this section, you should be able to:

- Establish a comprehensive system inventory and baseline configuration.
- Secure BIOS/UEFI settings to protect the boot process.
- Implement disk encryption and partitioning to safeguard data.
- Protect the boot directory from unauthorized modifications.
- Restrict USB port usage to enhance physical security.
- Apply regular system updates to address vulnerabilities.
- Manage packages effectively to maintain a lean and secure system.

Each topic in this section provides practical steps and best practices to help you achieve these objectives. We encourage you to follow along and apply these hardening measures to enhance the security of your Linux servers.
