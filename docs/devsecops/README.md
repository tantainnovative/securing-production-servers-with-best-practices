# DevSecOps Integration

Welcome to the DevSecOps Integration section of the Linux Hardening Guide. This section focuses on integrating security practices into development and operations workflows, enabling teams to build secure systems from the ground up.

## Topics Covered

1. **[Security in CI/CD Pipelines](ci_cd_security.md):** Implementing automated security testing and compliance checks in continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

2. **[Infrastructure as Code Security](infrastructure_as_code.md):** Securing infrastructure definitions and implementing policy as code for consistent security enforcement.

3. **[Container Security in Development](container_security_dev.md):** Integrating container security scanning and best practices into development workflows.

4. **[Secret Management](secret_management.md):** Implementing secure secret management practices across development, testing, and production environments.

5. **[Security Testing Automation](security_testing.md):** Automating security testing including SAST, DAST, and dependency scanning.

6. **[Policy as Code](policy_as_code.md):** Implementing security policies as code using tools like Open Policy Agent (OPA) and Falco.

## Objectives

By the end of this section, you should be able to:

- Integrate security scanning and testing into CI/CD pipelines
- Implement Infrastructure as Code security best practices
- Automate security compliance checking
- Manage secrets securely across all environments
- Implement continuous security monitoring
- Apply security policies as code

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with DevSecOps integration, ensure you have:
- Basic understanding of CI/CD concepts
- Familiarity with containerization technologies
- Knowledge of Infrastructure as Code tools (Terraform, Ansible, etc.)
- Understanding of security fundamentals covered in previous sections

## Modern DevSecOps Principles

### Shift Left Security
- **Early Detection:** Identify security issues during development, not after deployment
- **Developer Education:** Provide security training and tools to development teams
- **Automated Feedback:** Give immediate security feedback in development workflows

### Continuous Security
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement security monitoring throughout the entire pipeline
- **Automated Response:** Automate security incident response and remediation
- **Feedback Loops:** Create feedback mechanisms to improve security practices

### Collaboration and Culture
- **Shared Responsibility:** Make security everyone's responsibility, not just the security team
- **Transparency:** Provide visibility into security posture and incidents
- **Continuous Learning:** Foster a culture of continuous security improvement

Each topic in this section provides practical implementation guidance and real-world examples to help you successfully integrate security into your development and operations workflows.
